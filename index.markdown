## Introduction

### General Introduction and Purpose

**League of Legends** is a popular online multiplayer video game created by **Riot Games**, featuring one of the largest esports scenes for over a decade. The dataset used in this project is a professional dataset developed by **Oracleâ€™s Elixir**, containing data from professional **League of Legends** esports matches throughout **2025**.

This dataset includes a wide variety of statistics from matches played, making it useful for examining **player tendencies, team interactions, and game results**. It provides insights into **individual performance, strategic decisions, in-game metrics, and overall match progression**.

In any given match, two teams compete against each other (**red side** and **blue side**), with each team consisting of **five members**, each assigned a **specific role** throughout the game. The roles include **Top Lane, Jungle, Mid Lane, Bot Lane, and Support**. A key topic debated within the **League of Legends** community is the balance of these five roles. In other words, players discuss whether each role has an **equal impact** on the game's outcome.
